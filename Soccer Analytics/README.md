# Soccer Analytics


Developed a computer program in C++ working along side the Loras College soccer coach to use for game statistic tracking. The program allows for data collection which will be altered at a later time for various analytical purposes.


A collection of files relating to the statistical soccer program.

The SSP code file contains the code I wrote in C++ for the soccer computer program.

The Presentation file is a PDF of the final presentation given by myself and group members for a class. 

The SSP file contains the needed compnents to run the code in a terminal.
