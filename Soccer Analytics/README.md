# Soccer Analytics
The Loras Soccer Analytics Program came about after I completed an advanced course in C++ programming, and gained a growing interest in sports analytics. I spent most of the following summer creating a program in C++ that would input a player roster from a text document, allow a user to manually enter statistics in a simplified format as the game occurred, and output them at the end of the game in a csv format. I was also teaching myself the basics of R at the time, and eventually grew comfortable enough with the ggplot2 package to create visualizations for a presentation and analysis that the coach was able to use for the following season. The screen shot to the right is a visualization showing the success rate offensive pressure had throughout the season, one of the many stats that was looked at.
