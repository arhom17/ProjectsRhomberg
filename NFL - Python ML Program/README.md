The NFL Game Outcome Predictions project was a group project for one of my machine learning courses where we built a decision tree algorithm in Python to decide the outcome of a game based on various factors such as: home field advantage, 1st down difference, turn over difference, etc. The program produced a classification accuracy greater than 80%. The project was not designed to be used to predict future games or for personal use, but was instead a way for us to learn the elements used in decision tree algorithms, and practice upon them with a real world data set. The screen shot to the left is of some code that is used within the algorithm, written in Python.
