## Loading Data

First we'll pull in the data for the electricity that we recieved from Alliant.

```{r loadAlliant}

files <- dir("RawData/Alliant/FromAlliant/", full.names = TRUE)

files %>% 

  map_df(read_csv, skip=13) -> AlliantConsumptionRaw

AlliantConsumptionRaw %>% distinct() -> AlliantConsumptionRaw #I didn't make sure the data files didn't overlap when I downloaded them.



```
