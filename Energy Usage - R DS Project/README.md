The Energy Usage Analysis project was my final project for a data science course. The project was done entirely using R studio and various packages within. Data was provided from csv documents by our professor outlining energy usage statistics from his house in an unstructured format. We pulled weather data using an API from DarkSky.net. All of the data was cleaned and reported upon using the tipyverse and ggplot2 packages. Our professor had recently installed solar panels, so our task was to analyze and show that this was a financially smart decision. The screen shot to the right shows a chart made to compare the energy usage trends and bill price before and after the addition of solar panels. This personally was one of my favorite projects to work on as the cleansing, analyzing, and reporting upon the data was a challenge that actually resulted in beneficial information that our professor was able to utilize.
