In the wine classification project, I used a data set from an online source that had various red and white wines categorized by different fields such as: fixed acidity, pH levels, sulfates, etc. I utilized R packages to run a Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm to make predictions on the type of wine inputted, red or white, based on the given data. I also practiced working with discrete data as all of the variables were continuous within the original data set, and created rules within the excel docs for this transformation process. Both the continuous and discrete versions of the project produced a classification accuracy greater than 80%. The screen shot to the left is of the code used to load, train, and find the accuracy of the algorithm.
