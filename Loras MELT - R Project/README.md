The Loras MELT analysis project came about as a result of an iconic part of the first year experience one has when living in the residence halls, the heat. None of the halls have air conditioning, so the shock of heat that most first years experience in their beginning months sometimes encourages them to withdrawal early on, a term known by the school as MELT. My task for this project was to look at weather trends to analyze the amount of students that leave because of the heat, and some of the outstanding factors that could help predict this. I used an API from DarkSky.net to pull in weather data to R. A data set was provided from the school that listed student enrollment and withdrawal dates. The screen shot to the right shows some of the visualizations made to show how the temperature averaged throughout the day within a specific year. It was concluded (as hypothesized) that overall, the hotter the start of the year, the greater number of students who leave early on.
