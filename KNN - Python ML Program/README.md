The KNN program was a short practice at building our own machine learning algorithm in Python. I had been introduced and used KNN in other classes, but only as an externally installed package within R. This project was an exploration at how the algorithm actually works and functions in written code code. We utilized a data set about cars, bringing in various features for the algorithm to use to classify the type of car. To the left is a screen shot of some of the code that was written. This was one of the early projects I encountered working in Python, and was a great learning experience for the language and the machine learning processes.
